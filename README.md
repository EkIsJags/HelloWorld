> "Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, itâ€™s bad." - Cory House

I believe in the power of open-source and the spirit of collaboration. Hence, you can often find me contributing to various projects on GitHub. I learned that GitHub is widely used in the real world, and I'm happy I got exposed to it during my studies.
